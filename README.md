#  5. Builder

`Builder`:
-> Creational Design Pattern
-> Allows constructing complex objects step by step.


Unlike other creational patterns, **Builder** doesn’t require products to have a common interface. 
That makes it possible to produce different products using the same construction process.
It’s especially useful when you need to create an object with lots of possible configuration options.
